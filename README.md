Welcome to my first React project repository, featuring a user-friendly Todo application designed to streamline task management. This app allows users to effortlessly add new todos, keeping track of their total count and the number of completed tasks. With a simple interface, users can mark todos as completed by clicking on their names and delete them by clicking on the associated cross icon.
